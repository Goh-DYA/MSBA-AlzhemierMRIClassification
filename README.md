# Multi-class Image Classification of MRI Brain Scans for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease

### Background: 
Dementia, a debilitating condition, progressively impairs an individual’s work performance, daily activities, and social interactions. Notably, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60-70% of all cases. Despite extensive research, no definitive cure for Alzheimer’s exists. However, early diagnosis is crucial as it opens a wider array of treatment options.

### Objective: 
Train a deep learning classifier to analyse MRI brain scans, assisting healthcare professionals in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, the model will be based on transfer learning of the pre-trained Densenet121 & Inception-v3 model.

### Dataset: 
- Curated version of the OASIS Alzhemier's Dataset, which consists of 22265 brain MRI images obtained from 347 unique patients 
- Original Full Dataset: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis)

### Repository
- The full code experiments that were run can be found in the "Code" folder.
- A shortened jupyter notebook summarising one of the code experiments (involving multi-class classification using Densenet121) was also uploaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adisongoh/alzhemier-classification-with-pretrained-densenet).
- Feel free to read the PDF report for more in-depth information on the project.
